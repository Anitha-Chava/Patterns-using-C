# C Programming Patterns

This repository contains a collection of 13 different patterns implemented in C. Each pattern is a classic programming exercise that helps developers enhance their understanding of loops, conditionals, and basic data structures.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anitha-chava/C-Patterns.git
```

Each pattern is implemented in its own C file with a clear and descriptive filename. To compile and run a specific pattern, navigate to its corresponding file and use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc pattern_name.c -o pattern_name
./pattern_name
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these patterns in your projects or as learning exercises. Contributions and improvements are welcome via pull requests.
